# YARPM

Yet Another Rich Presence Manager, duh.

This time it works, not like the others ðŸ˜’

## Backstory

I opened GIMP, discod didnt recognize it. added it manually, it transformed into whatever the window name was, which instead of being `"GIMP"`, it was something like

```"GNU Image Manipulation Program â€“ [Layer 1 copy #38] â€“ Untitled.xcf (RGB, 12 layers) 50% (Indexed Color, 256 colors, 1 channel)"```

which we both know it doesnt look good.

I searched the web, but no linux-supported non-abandoned answers were found. so i made it myself

## The idea

The idea is easy:

C++ to take processes and list them. replace processName (`gimp`) to something that doesn't make your eyes bleed (`GIMP`) OR anyting you could want (`Edithing photos`, `Free Photoshop`, `GIMP > Ps`, `Drawing anime`), or anything else **(dont use slurs, you'll get nuked)**

And i thought (yes sometimes i do that): Why only names? lets go all in: GUI, custom name, custom Image, custom time, custom type, custom anything you're allowed to customize. and this is it.

## IOU

You cant right now.
